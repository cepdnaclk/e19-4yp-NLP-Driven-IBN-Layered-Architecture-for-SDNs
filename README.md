### **🖧 NLP-Driven Intent-Based Networking Layered-Architecture for SDNs**

**🔍 Research Project | Final Year Computer Engineering**  

This repository contains the implementation, experiments, and documentation for our research on **NLP-driven Intent-Based Networking (IBN) for Software-Defined Networks (SDNs)**. Our approach leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and SDN programmability** to enable dynamic, intelligent, and adaptive network configuration based on high-level user intents.
